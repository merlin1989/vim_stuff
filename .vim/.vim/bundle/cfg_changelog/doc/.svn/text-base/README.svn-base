This little vim plugin writes a changelog to /users/osr/changelog/ everytime an SRC config file is changed. 
With this changelog you can comprehend what changes are made to which configuration file.
In worst case you could rebuild an old configuration if needed (I would prefere undotree, another vim plugin, for that, but it's not supported by the vim version installed on our servers).

In case you made a change, after a day or two (for some a few hours are enough to forget what they've changed) you recognize you messed it up but you can't remember what you have changed --> check the changlog.


Installation:

There are two ways to install it:

1. Install via automatic install script (preferred way).
	
	Just execute install.sh (--help) everything is easy to understand for someone with IT background.
	The installer is going to install an improved .vimrc, pathogen (a plugin manager for vim), and the changelog writer.
	It also verifys you have a compatible Vim version installed. 

2. Manual install
	
	Create the .vim directory structure in your home directory:
		.vim/doc
		.vim/plugin
		.vim/autoload
		and so on...
	Copy the plugin files to plugin, doc files to doc and autoload files to autoload (not needed by changelog plugin)
	Add the following lines to your .vimrc:

	autocmd BufWrite *cfg*.py* :DiffChanges
	nnoremap <F6> :DiffChangesPatchToggle<CR>
	nnoremap <F7> :DiffChangesDiffToggle<CR>

How to use the plugin:

	Once you opend a config file, make a change and save it. After saving a process.changelog.osrid file is created in ~/changelog/.
	To see the actual changes you made since last save you can press "F6".
	To see all the changes done since installing the plugin, you can press "F7".
	Both switches are toggle switches, just press it again to close the buffer.
	If you are not happy with my decision to bind the functions to F6 and F7 you can change them on you own, just change the following lines in your .vimrc:
	        nnoremap <F6> :DiffChangesPatchToggle<CR>
                nnoremap <F7> :DiffChangesDiffToggle<CR>


Features:

	Multiple instance support is included.
	All configs which contain cfg and .py are used if you want to change the name for a test config (spider_cfg_test.py --> spider_cfg_test.py.changelog.osr1)
	If you change a config which is not located in the real config path a "no_id" is going to be added as osr id, the changelog would then look like process.py.changelog.no_id (I take the osrId from the path).
	The ip of the editor is saved in the changelog.
	Path where the cfg is located is also saved in the changelog.

What does the changelog look like?
